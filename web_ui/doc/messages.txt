===== Game "ant-war:lobby" =====

<join lobby>

        This is called to enter the lobby and begin engaging with other users in
        the process of selecting who will join a game.
    Example:
        {
            action: "setGame",
            gameId: "ant-war:lobby",
            playerId: <username>,
        }


requestListOfGames
    Description:
        This is called to request that anyone in the lobby who is currently offering
        a public game and looking for participants send the announceNewGame message.
    Example:
        {
            action: "sendMessage",
            gameId: "ant-war:lobby",

            },
        }


announceNewGame
    Description:
        This is called by a participant who wants to host a public game and is offering to
        allow others to join it. It includes a description of the game being offered. It
        is sent when a participant first decides to offer the game and also whenever someone
        sends requestListOfGames.
    Example:
        {
            action: "sendMessage",
            gameId: "ant-war:lobby",

                    gameCode: <offeredGameCode>,
                    hostUsername: <username>,

        }


withdrawNewGame
    Description:
        This is called by a participant who HAD been offering to host a public game but now
        is no longer offering that game (perhaps they changed their mind, perhaps the game
        filled up).
    Example:
        {
            action: "sendMessage",
            gameId: "ant-war:lobby",
            data: {
                event: "withdrawNewGame",
                gameData: {
                    gameCode: <offeredGameCode>,

            gameId: "ant-war:lobby",
            data: {
                event: "requestToJoinGame",
                gameCode: <acceptedGameCode>,
                playerId: <username>,
            },
        }


initializeGame
    Description:
        This is called by a participant who is planning to host a game after receiving a
        requestToJoinGame message to inform the player that their request has been granted
        and they should now leave the lobby and join the game.
    Example:
        {
            action: "sendMessage",
            gameId: "ant-war:lobby",
            data: {
                event: "initializeGame",
                gameData: {
                    gameCode: <gameCode>,
                    map: <selectedMap>,
                    rules: <selectedRules>,
