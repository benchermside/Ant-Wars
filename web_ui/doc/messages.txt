===== Game "ant-war:lobby" =====

<join lobby>
    Description:
        This is sent to enter the lobby and begin engaging with other users in
        the process of selecting who will join a game.
    Example:
        {
            action: "setGame",
            gameId: "ant-war:lobby",
            playerId: <username>,
        }


requestListOfGames
    Description:
        This is sent to request that anyone in the lobby who is currently offering
        a public game and looking for participants send the announceNewGame message.
    Example:
        {
            action: "sendMessage",
            gameId: "ant-war:lobby",
            data: {
                event: "requestListOfGames",
            },
        }


announceNewGame
    Description:
        This is sent by a participant who wants to host a public game and is offering to
        allow others to join it. It includes a description of the game being offered. It
        is sent when a participant first decides to offer the game and also whenever someone
        sends requestListOfGames.
    Example:
        {
            action: "sendMessage",
            gameId: "ant-war:lobby",
            data: {

                gameData: {
                    gameCode: <offeredGameCode>,
                    hostUsername: <username>,
                    map: <selectedMap>,
                    rules: <selectedRules>,
                },
            },
        }


withdrawNewGame
    Description:
        This is sent by a participant who HAD been offering to host a public game but now
        is no longer offering that game (perhaps they changed their mind, perhaps the game
        filled up).
    Example:
        {
            action: "sendMessage",
            gameId: "ant-war:lobby",
            data: {
                event: "withdrawNewGame",
                gameData: {
                    gameCode: <offeredGameCode>,
                },
            },
        }


requestToJoinGame
    Description:
        This is sent by a participant asking to join a particular game (public OR private).
    Example:
        {
            action: "sendMessage",
            gameId: "ant-war:lobby",
            data: {
                event: "requestToJoinGame",
                gameCode: <acceptedGameCode>,
                playerId: <username>,
            },
        }


initializeGame
    Description:
        This is sent by a participant who is planning to host a game after receiving a
        requestToJoinGame message to inform the player that their request has been granted
        and they should now leave the lobby and join the game.
    Example:
        {
            action: "sendMessage",
            gameId: "ant-war:lobby",
            data: {
                event: "initializeGame",
                gameSettings: {
                    gameCode: <gameCode>,
                    map: <selectedMap>,
                    rules: <selectedRules>,
                    playerList: [
                        {
                            playerType: "Human",
                            username: "Ann",
                        },
                        {
                            playerType: "AI",
                            username: "RandomRobot",
                            aiType: "RandomMover",
                        },
                    ],
                },
            },
        }

        they receive (or send) the initializeGame message.
    Example:
        {
            action: "setGame",

        }


announceColonySelections

        This message is sent when a player has determined what actions they intend to take
        and they want to announce that to the host. They ARE permitted to send a new message
        again later which will override the first one.
    Example:
        {
            action: "sendMessage",
            gameId: "ant-war:g:<gameCode>",

            },
        }

        turn beginning.
    Example:
        {
            action: "sendMessage",
            gameId: "ant-war:g:<gameCode>",
            data: {
